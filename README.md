The Fiscal Evaluation Model for China (FEMC) is a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model featuring multiple households and sectors. It integrates classic CGE model with the quantity theory of money, a Hicksian utility and decomposition framework. The FEMC is designed to evaluate a wide range of economic indicators, including firm output, household income and utility, employment, exchange rates, trade flows, and inequality.
